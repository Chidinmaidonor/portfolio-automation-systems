###3. Smart Patrolling Robot System for Intrusion Detection and Access Control
- **Overview:** Designed and implemented an Embedded Intrusion Detection and Patrolling Robot System for apartment security. The system uses microcontroller-based control to autonomously patrol designated routes, detect intrusions through onboard sensors (PIR/ultrasonic), and trigger alerts via IoT connectivity. Integrated real-time control algorithms ensured accurate navigation and obstacle avoidance, while the system was optimized for low power consumption and reliability in continuous operation.  
- **Tech Used:**
    - Control Systems: PID control for navigation, sensor fusion for obstacle detection

    - Sensors & Actuators: PIR Motion Sensor, Ultrasonic Sensor, Motor Drivers, Servo Motors

    - Software & Development Tools: C++, MATLAB/Simulink for modeling
- [üëâ View Project](projects/traffic-light-plc/README.md)
